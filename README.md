# Capstone Project

## By: Reynaldo Linares

## Overview
This project will be using the multiple APIs to create an asynchronous web app which will dynamically update the UI with fetched data along with data entered by the end user. In this case, you will be able to see information about your future travel plans in this handy travel app.

## Dependencies
This project requires the use of Webpack and all it's dependecies

## Usage
Pretty self explanatory, you have 3 fields, fill them out with your planned next vacation or dream vacation, and in a matter of seconds you will see some details about that trip. The webpage dynamically updates with current information about your location. I hope you enjoy using it.
